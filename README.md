###  Information

   Welcome visitor,
   
   This is my dots repository!
   
   In other words, it is where I keep my configs in case I decide to reinstall my setup.
   
   Keep in mind that I am using Archcraft, which is a distro that has a lot of configurations already built in. I just change the overall theme to my liking.
   
   The configurations for rofi, dunst, picom, etc. are the ones used in Archcraft.

   - **WM:** [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
   - **OS:** [Archcraft](https://archcraft.io/)
   - **Terminal:** [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
   - **Panel:** [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/)
